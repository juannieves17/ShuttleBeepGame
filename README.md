Shuttle Beep Game
================
Here is the Java Project for the Shuttle Beep Game that I created in collaboration of Jonathan A. Nieves.

Develop a game similar to Battleship game ; however, we call it Shuttle Beep. In fact, we assume 5 of our water 
shuttles are sunk under water and we are trying to find them and take them out. Shuttle Beep plays 
exactly same way that Battleship is played—just with a different mindset: you are trying to find your 
sunken shuttles in the ocean instead of trying to sink your opponent’s boats.
